## PHP Exercise for the role of Senior PHP Developer
Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

## Installation

```
composer install

npm install

php artisan serve

```

## Configuration

- Ensure a valid email driver is configured
- configure <b>RAPID_API_KEY</b> and <b>RAPID_API_HOST</b> environment variables in the <i>.env</i> file


## License

The Laravel framework is open-sourced software licensed under the [MIT license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).
